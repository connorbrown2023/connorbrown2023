### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Connor Brown
#### Development 
I'm a 26-year-old from England with a fervent interest in computer science. My journey is particularly focused on AI, but I also explore VR,
blockchain, and even quantum computing. I am currently pursuing a degree with the intention to advance to a master's in Artificial Intelligence, a field where I see my future. My path has included engaging in Python bootcamps and various online courses in coding, web development, machine learning, data science, and app development. 

Skills: Python / C# / HTML / CSS / JavaScript
